When route.run() is called, it iterates through the registered paths and runs the corresponding callback for the current path, which is determined by matching the path against the current URL. The example code adds a callback to the route for the "exercise2" path that logs a message to the console when that path is visited. Finally, the code immediately invokes an anonymous function that creates the route object and calls route.run(). check logs</p>

          It first checks if the element is a div, and if so, logs a message to the console. It then checks if the element has the class "element", and logs a message to the console if it does. It also checks if the element is not visible, and logs a message to the console if it is not visible.
          
          After the checks, it animates the width of the element to 200 pixels over a duration of 1500 milliseconds using jQuery's animate function. Finally, it checks if the element is currently being animated, and logs a message to the console if it is.</p>

        The code then uses the exist function to check if a h1 element exists on the page using $('h1').exist(). If it exists, the string "h1 exists" is logged to the console. If it does not exist, the string "h1 does not exist" is logged to the console.
        
        The code then does a similar check for an element with a selector of l1, which does not exist on the page. The result of this check will always be false, so the string "l1 does not exist" is logged to the console.</p>

        content: `
        <h1>Install jQuery CDN</h1>
        <p>It is generally better to use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to include a library like jQuery rather than including it using a script tag with a URL to the library file, like the example shown in the question. Here are some reasons why:

        Faster load times: CDNs usually have multiple servers distributed across various locations around the world, so when a user requests a file, it is served from the server closest to them. This reduces the latency and the time it takes for the file to load, resulting in a faster overall page load time.
        
        Increased reliability: CDNs are designed to handle heavy traffic loads, so they are typically more reliable than hosting the file yourself. If your server goes down, the file can still be served from the CDN.
        
        Version control: With a CDN, you can specify which version of a library you want to use in your code, and the CDN will serve that specific version. This makes it easy to update or roll back to a specific version of a library.
        
        Reduced bandwidth usage: By using a CDN, you can reduce the amount of bandwidth your server uses to serve files, which can save you money on hosting costs.
        
        Overall, using a CDN for libraries like jQuery is a best practice that can improve performance, reliability, and maintainability of your website or application.</p>

        <p>The code creates three buttons with unique IDs ('btn1', 'btn2', and 'btn3') and appends them before an element with the ID 'container' using jQuery. Then, it creates references to these buttons and the container element.

        The code sets up event handlers on the container element for three custom events: 'jump', 'punch', and 'click'. When the 'jump' event is triggered on the container, an alert is displayed with the message "Jump". When the 'punch' event is triggered on the container with a data parameter, an alert is displayed with the message "Punching [data]!". When the 'click' event is triggered on the container, an alert is displayed with the message "Simulating a Click".
        
        Finally, the code sets up click event handlers on the three buttons. When the 'click' event is triggered on button1, it triggers the 'jump' event on the container. When the 'click' event is triggered on button2, it triggers the 'punch' event on the container with the string 'you' as the data parameter. When the 'click' event is triggered on button3, it triggers the 'click' event on the container.</p>

          <h1>Public APIs</h1>
          <p>Using APIs with AJAX can be a powerful way to fetch data from remote servers and integrate them into your web application. AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it allows you to make requests to the server without reloading the page.

          One way to get started with using APIs and AJAX is by exploring the collection of public APIs available on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#animals. This repository contains a list of APIs across different categories that are available for public use.
          
          To use an API listed on this repository, you can first obtain an API key from the provider's website or by following their instructions on how to access the data. Once you have the API key, you can make an AJAX request to the API endpoint using JavaScript's built-in fetch() method or the jQuery $.ajax() method.</p>
          <p>For example, let's say you want to use the "Dog CEO" API to fetch a random image of a dog. You can make an AJAX request to the API endpoint using the fetch() method as follows:</p>
          <div id="publicAPI">
          <code>
          fetch('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => {
            // do something with the data
            console.log(data);
          })
          .catch(error => console.error(error));

          </code>
          </div>
          <p>This will send a request to the API endpoint and return a response containing a random image of a dog in JSON format. You can then parse the JSON data and use it to display the image on your webpage or perform any other desired action.

          Overall, using APIs with AJAX can be a great way to enrich your web application with external data. By exploring the public APIs available on the GitHub repository, you can find a wide range of data sources to integrate into your project.</p>

If the AJAX request is successful, the response data is logged to the console, and a new HTML element with the ID "users" is added to the page, displaying the JSON data in a formatted code block. If the AJAX request fails, an alert message is displayed.</p>

          <p>Masonry is a popular JavaScript library used for creating responsive, grid-style layouts. It works by positioning elements vertically in columns with minimal vertical gaps, like a masonry wall. This layout is achieved by determining the available width of the container element and calculating the optimal column width based on the desired column count and the width of each individual element.

          To use Masonry, you typically start by initializing a new Masonry instance with a container element and specifying options like column width, gutter size, and item selector. Then, you add your individual elements to the container element, and Masonry will automatically position them within the grid layout.
          
          Masonry also provides a number of methods and events that can be used to manipulate the layout dynamically, such as adding or removing elements or adjusting the size of the container. This allows for a highly flexible and customizable layout that can adapt to different screen sizes and content types.</p>

          Key points:
          
          Webcam settings are configured with width, height, image format, and quality.
          Webcam is attached to an HTML element with id 'container'.
          A 'Take a snapshot' button is created and inserted after the 'container' element.
          On button click, a snapshot is taken and displayed in the 'picture' element.
          The WebcamJS library is loaded via a CDN link, and the 'loaded' function is executed upon completion.</p>

          <p>This code demonstrates the use of jQuery and external libraries to create interactive web components. It consists of three examples:

          A date picker using the Pickadate.js library. It appends the necessary CSS and JS files, creates an input element for date selection, and initializes the date picker with a minimum date set to the current date.
          A file drop zone using the Dropzone.js library. It adds necessary styles and creates a drop zone to handle file uploads.
          An element rumble effect using the jRumble library. It creates two buttons to control the rumble effect on two different elements and imports the jRumble library to apply the effect.
          Each example uses the $(window).on('load', () => {...}); event to execute code when the page finishes loading.</p>
